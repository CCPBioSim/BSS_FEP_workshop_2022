When we look at the edges suggested by LOMAP that have low scores, we see that some are likely to be unreliable in FEP. Luckily, this is because cycle formation/removal in a single-topology-style FEP must be from/to a hydrogen, not a carbon atom. This is why we have introduced 'intermediate_H', so this has largely been solved by generating the network again above. Still, the below syntax can be used if any edges are to be removed."
