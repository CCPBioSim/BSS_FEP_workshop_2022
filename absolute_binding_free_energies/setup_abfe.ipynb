    "\n",
    "The absolute binding free energy can be obtained by adding up the terms round our free energy cycle, not forgetting any [symmetry corrections](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0046853) (for example if there is more than 1 symmetrical binding site per protein):\n",

    "The price paid for greater generality is that these calculations are generally harder to converge, as a result of the larger \"perturbation\" made (complete removal of the ligand).\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways ABFE calculations are simpler than RBFE calculations, in that we do not need to align and merge two ligands. However, ABFE calculations require receptor-ligand restraints (these are shown by the red dotted lines above) in order to prevent sampling issues. Among other issues, without restraints the ligand would float away from the binding site as the ligand's intermolecular interactions were removed. In order to obtain converged free energies of binding, we would have to be sure that the ligand was sampling outside the binding site as soon as the unbound state became comparable in free energy to the bound state, and that we were correctly estimating the ratios of the sizes of the simulation box to the binding site; in practice, this is not feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use a very popular set of receptor-ligand restraints originally proposed by [Boresch et al.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jp0217839) which restrain all 6 external degrees of freedom (three translational and three rotational) of the ligand with respect to the receptor. This is done by imposing harmonic restraints on one distance, two angles, and three dihedral angles defined by three anchor points in the protein (P1-3) and three in the ligand (L1-3):\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to correct for the presence of restraints. Intuitively, we can see that the volume accessible to the non-interacting ligand in state 3 will be different to that accessible in state 4 with the restraints applied, so there must be a free energy change. The standard free energy of releasing the restraint is calculated according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $V_L$ and $\\xi_L$ are the effective translational and rotational volumes for the restrained non-interacting ligand, and $V^o$ is the standard state volume (1660 &#x212B;$^3$, which corresponds to 1 mol l $^{-1}$).  The use of the standard state volume makes the correction independent of the size of the simulation box. $8\\pi^2$ is the rotational \"volume\" of an unrestrained ligand. Imagine pointing the z axis of a 3D Cartesian coordinate system anywhere on the surface of a sphere - this gives a contribution of $4\\pi$ steradians. For each orientation of the z axis, the x and y axes can be rotated through $2\\pi$ radians, giving a total of $2\\pi4\\pi = 8\\pi^2$.\n",

    "The performance of ABFE calculations can be highly dependent on the restraints used. Considering the simulations connecting states 6 and 7 (see cycle above), we would like the restraints to be weak, so that the unrestrained complex is minimally perturbed and convergence is quickly achieved. However, the fastest convergence of the simulations connecting stages 4, 5, and 6 will likely be achieved by using relatively strong restraints to restrict the configurational volume which must be sampled as much as possible. We can strike a compromise between these opposing requirements by selecting the restraints to mimic native protein-ligand interactions as closely as possible, which allows us to find the strongest possible restraints which minimally perturb the unrestrained fully interacting state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Boresch restraints have instabilites which are most commonly encountered when any of the contiguous anchor points are close to collinear. This results in large fluctuations in the dihedral angles and the application of large torques through the dihedral restraints - this can \"blow-up\" the molecular dynamics integrator, causing the simulation to crash. So, we must be careful to avoid such poor selections when choosing our restraint. \n",

    "BioSimSpace allows you to select Boresch restraints in an automated way, by running an unrestrained simulation of the fully interacting complex to allow the dynamics of the ligand with respect to the protein to be analysed.

Candidate sets of Boresch restraints are generated and the fluctuations of the associated Boresch degrees of freedom are tracked over the unrestrained simulation. The optimum Boresch degrees of freedom are then selected as the set having the lowest total variance, and satisfying certain geometric criteria to ensure stability. The force constants of the restraints are set to some pre-defined value (here 10 kcal mol $\\mathrm{^{-1}}$ &#x212B;$\\mathrm{^{-2}}$ or kcal mol $\\mathrm{^{-1}}$ $\\mathrm{rad^{-2}}$).\n",

We will need to run three bound leg simulations to account for turning on the restraints, discharging (Coulombic interactions), and vanishing (Lennard-Jones interactions) the ligand. Note that the perturbation types required for these stages are \"restraint\", \"discharge_soft\", and \"vanish_soft\", respectively.\n",

    "One important parameter is the number of $\\mathrm{\\lambda}$ windows selected, as their number and spacing will affect the reliability of the free energy estimates in an estimator-dependent way. We plan to use the [multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.2978177), which requires sufficient phase space overlap between adjacent $\\mathrm{\\lambda}$ windows - we must have a high enough probability of observing the samples we generate at one value of $\\mathrm{\\lambda}$ at the neighbouring values of $\\mathrm{\\lambda}$. Unfortunately, the optimum set of $\\mathrm{\\lambda}$ values is system-specific and is not easily predicted before running any simulations. For this system, we ran a test simulation with a set of lambda windows taken from a previous study and added or removed windows to ensure sufficient overlap without having too many windows, which would be a waste of simulation time. \n",
