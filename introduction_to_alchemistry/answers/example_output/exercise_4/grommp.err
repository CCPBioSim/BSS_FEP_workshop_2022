Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Working dir:  /home/anna/Documents/september_2022_workshops/bssccpbiosim2022/introduction_to_alchemistry/exercise_4
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f ions.mdp -po ions.out.mdp -c solvated.gro -p solvated.top -o ions.tpr


NOTE 1 [file ions.mdp]:
  For a correct single-point energy evaluation with nsteps = 0, use
  continuation = yes to avoid constraining the input coordinates.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 5319.00

NOTE 2 [file ions.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.
